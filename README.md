## About Wunderlist 2.0

Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.

## Working On This Project

### **The Build** Sprint **Git Work Flow**

- ❗️**DO NOT** fork the project. There is no need to fork a project in Lambda Labs/Build Sprints because YOU own them.
- Clone the master branch of the repository.
- Checkout a branch (`git checkout -b <branch-name>`) every time you start work on a new feature.  Make sure the feature + your name is in the title of the branch.  Example: `Nav-Bar-AustenAllred`
- Open a Pull Request Draft and add your Project Leader as a reviewer so that they can perform a code review.
    - [https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
- Project Leaders will merge branches back into the master branch once a code review has been completed.
